# noob_speedrun

A repository of implementations done by Sahil Khose and Aditya Kane under approximately 2 hours. Training not included in this time. 

Ideally, we plan to add one or two papers per week. Do check out [Sahil Khose's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SahilKhose) for explanation videos of the models.

Models implemented so far:
